# <Code-Refractor>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

The motivation behind this project was to understand the importance of having accessible and easy to follow code to read so that I can start developing that mindset with future code I make. Having this project built gave me real time practice of what potential clients would expect, and gave me hands on experience to see what changes I made would work, and would not work, which in turn helps solves the problem of keeping code organized and and easier to follow and maintain for any future changes or implementations that a client or partner developer may want to be added. I learned the importance of accessibility and why it is vital to have organized code which would be to help increase efficiency, ability to edit or debug syntax and add new or change current features with more ease.
